# Cat Photo App
A simple HTML project from the freeCodeCamp curriculum, built using a Trunk-Based Development workflow. This project is a simple web page created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum. It's designed to introduce the fundamentals of HTML by building a basic application that displays photos and information about cats.

## Project Description
The Cat Photo App is a single-page website that showcases various cat pictures and includes a form for users to submit their own cat photos. This project serves as a practical introduction to web development, covering essential concepts like:
- HTML Structure: Learn how to create the basic skeleton of a webpage using HTML tags.
- Text Elements: Use headings (h1, h2) and paragraphs (p) to structure content.
- Image Elements: Embed images into the webpage.
- Links: Create hyperlinks to other web pages.
- Forms: Build a simple form with text inputs, radio buttons, and checkboxes.

## Why this project is useful
This project provides a hands-on learning experience for beginners who are new to web development. It allows you to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world project, reinforcing your understanding of HTML. By the end of this project, you will have a tangible result that you can share and build upon.
