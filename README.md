# Cat Photo App
A simple HTML project from the freeCodeCamp curriculum, built using a Trunk-Based Development workflow. This project is a simple web page created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum. It's designed to introduce the fundamentals of HTML by building a basic application that displays photos and information about cats.

## Project Description
The Cat Photo App is a single-page website that showcases various cat pictures and includes a form for users to submit their own cat photos. This project serves as a practical introduction to web development, covering essential concepts like:
- HTML Structure: Learn how to create the basic skeleton of a webpage using HTML tags.
- Text Elements: Use headings (h1, h2) and paragraphs (p) to structure content.
- Image Elements: Embed images into the webpage.
- Links: Create hyperlinks to other web pages.
- Forms: Build a simple form with text inputs, radio buttons, and checkboxes.

## Why this project is useful
This project provides a hands-on learning experience for beginners who are new to web development. It allows you to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world project, reinforcing your understanding of HTML. By the end of this project, you will have a tangible result that you can share and build upon.

## How to get started
To get started with this project, you can follow the freeCodeCamp curriculum on their website. The project is broken down into small, manageable steps that guide you through the process of building the Cat Photo App from scratch.

## Development Methodology
This project was built using **Trunk-Based Development (TBD)** to simulate a professional, agile workflow. The key practices followed include:
*   **Short-Lived Feature Branches:** All work was done on small, single-purpose branches that were merged into the `main` trunk quickly.
*   **Always-Releasable Trunk:** The `main` branch was kept stable and "releasable" at all times.
*   **Conventional Commits:** All commits follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for a clean, readable, and automated Git history.
*   **Pull Request Reviews:** Every change was integrated via a Pull Request to allow for review and automated checks (a practice simulated for this solo project).

The goal was not just to build a webpage, but to practice the development discipline required for modern software engineering teams.
